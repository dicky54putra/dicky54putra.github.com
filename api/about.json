I like to learn new things and make my new experiences.\n\nIn the programming world I idolize many developers, for example: Sandhika Galih (web programming unpas), eko (programmer zaman now), samanthaming, frontendjoe, theprogrammingexpert, etc. someday I want to be like them, experts in their fields and share with others.\n\nnow I'm \"emptying my glass and looking for water from many sources\" and these are some of the things I've been enjoying quite a bit recently\n- Find more project as Freelancer\n- Reading article on Medium or Dev.to\n- Bought some online classes about Programming and got it done \n\nLast but not least, stay healthy and keep a safe distance!",
